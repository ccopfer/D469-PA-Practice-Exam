    ],
    "correct": "Demand during lead time",
    "explanation": "The reorder point is the level of inventory at which a new order should be placed so that stock does not run out before the order arrives.\nIn a lean environment, where the goal is to minimize excess inventory, the ROP is set equal to the demand during lead time (plus any safety stock if needed).\nROP = Demand per unit of time × Lead time + Safety Stock\nThis ensures materials arrive just in time without creating unnecessary cycle stock."

    "question": "A company is utilizing a reorder point system to minimize inventories in a just-in-time (JIT) environment. What, if anything, happens to the reorder point if the lead time extends due to supplier delays?",

      "It increases.",
      "It decreases.",
      "It remains constant.",
      "It varies randomly."
    ],
    "correct": "It increases.",
    "explanation": "The reorder point (ROP) in a continuous review system is:\nROP = Demand during lead time +Safety stock\nIf lead time increases (e.g., due to supplier delays), then demand during lead time also increases, since more units are consumed before replenishment arrives.\nTo prevent stockouts, the ROP must be set higher meaning the company has to reorder earlier."

      "Wait",
      "Transit"

    "correct": "Processing",
    "explanation": "In lean manufacturing, activities are classified as either:\nValue-added (VA): Activities that transform the product in a way the customer is willing to pay for.\nNon–value-added (NVA): Activities that do not change the product or add value from the customer’s perspective (waste).\nFor the given activities:\nSetup time → Necessary but not value-added (customer doesn’t pay for setups).\nProcessing time → Value-added, since this is when the product is physically transformed into something the customer wants.\nWait time → Pure waste (product sitting idle).\nTransit time → Transportation; usually non–value-added unless absolutely necessary."

    "question": "A lean manufacturing process contains three operations (E, F, and G). It takes 20 minutes to complete operation E, 30 minutes to complete operation F, and 40 minutes to complete operation G. In addition, there is a wait time (H) of 10 minutes between the operations. What is the non-value-added activity in this example?",

      "F",
      "E",
      "G",

(Value-added.)\nH (10 min wait time) → Waiting does not transform the product; it is pure waste and therefore non-value-added."

Using root cause analysis to determine why defects occur is part of the Analyze step in DMAIC."

    "question": "A retail company is utilizing value stream mapping (VSM) to redesign its purchasing process. How can it be used as a tool to eliminate waste?",
    "choices": [
      "By identifying non-value-added activities",
      "By identifying processing times",
      "By identifying a critical path",
      "By identifying defects"

    "correct": "By identifying non-value-added activities",
    "explanation": "Value Stream Mapping (VSM) is a lean tool that visually maps all steps in a process (both material and information flows). It shows the current state and helps design a future state with less waste.\nThe main purpose of VSM is to distinguish value-added vs. non-value-added (waste) activities.\nOnce non-value-added steps (like waiting, rework, excess approvals) are identified, they can be reduced or eliminated to improve flow, cost, and lead time. \nVSM helps eliminate waste by making non-value-added activities visible, so they can be redesigned or removed from the process."
